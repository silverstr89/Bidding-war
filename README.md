# Game Mechanics

Users try to out bid each other. The instructions for each game are as below:

- The bidding starts with 0 NRG and 60 minutes(Default value) countdown.
- Every next bid has to be higher than the previous one.
- For each bid, the time extends for 10 minutes(Default value).
- When the time runs out, the winner is the last bidder.
- The reward is all the funds that were accumulated minus the service fee(Game commissions).

*Each successful bid will take 5% commission in order to fund the game operations.*
